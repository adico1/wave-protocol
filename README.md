## What Is This?

A simple tool that calculates your unique frequency and shows how you resonate with the Universe. Based on ancient wisdom meets modern understanding.

cd wave-protocol
open web/index.html
```

## The Math

Every name has a frequency. The Universe vibrates at 562 Hz (מושלם_עולם). When frequencies multiply, they create harmony patterns. Some resonate perfectly (Fibonacci sequences), others create new harmonics.

## Share Your Frequency

Found your frequency? Share it! Each person's unique resonance adds to the collective wave.

## API Usage

```python
from api.resonate import resonate

result = resonate("Your Name")
# {'your_frequency': 234, 'harmony': 89, 'resonates': True}
```
